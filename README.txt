# snasphysicist's Talks

You'll find in each folder in this repository
slides, example code, markup, etc... I've used
when developing and presenting talks.

I'm currently using [marp](https://marp.app/)
to avoid having to use e.g. Powerpoint, Slides, etc...

You can run `convert.sh` to (re)build all
the presentable documents (HTML/PDF) from 
the markdown, but you'll need marp installed.
